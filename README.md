# Is Tom Brady really the Greatest Of All Time
## COMM 318 Final  Project

For my final project, I analyzed Tom Brady's performance over his career on the New England Patriots. The full project and data analysis can be seen here: (once it is on GitHub). Attached is my data story, which interprets my analysis for this project.

Data for this project was used from FiveThirtyEight's NFL Elo Rating Dataset, containing data from every NFL game from 1920 to today, and Google Trends data.
